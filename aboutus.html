  <h1>Mapping the world’s music museums and archives</h1>
    <h3>Why are we doing this?</h3>
    <p>
    Through our work as academics and music archivists we’ve been interested for
    quite some time in how people and communities across the world collect,
    preserve, share and celebrate their music heritage. This is done in many different
    ways and via many different platforms. We are interested in where, what, how
    and why these practices take place.
    <br/>
    Our aim is to visualize all the amazing types of music museums and archives that
    exist and to continually add to the collection. In doing this we believe it will be:
    <ul>
    <li>A valuable resource for academics and researchers who are interested in
    music history and cultural heritage </li>

    <li>It will enable music museums and archives to better connect with each
    other by highlighting other similar types of practices</li>

    <li>It will be of use for those with an interest in music history in general, and
    for music tourists (find the places to visit on your next trip!)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>What is this site for?</h3>

    <p>
    As well as presenting our findings by traditional academic means (in journal
    articles, at conferences and so on), we want to disseminate our research in more
    publicly accessible formats. So we’ve taken all the data we’ve collected so far and
    created this site with the help of Maria Crosas, a journalist and data visualization
    expert.
    <br/>
    It is our intention to open the site up so anyone can add their own, or others they
    know or use, museums and archives so this site will continually grow and evolve
    and become more representative of music and its heritage.
    </p>

    <h3>How do I get involved?</h3>

    <p>We’ve devised some descriptors to help categorise the museums and archives we
    are mapping and what the nodes and colours represent. You can see this below.
    To add your own examples of music museums and archives simply submit the Google Form on <thead>
    'Add an archive' tab and we will review the content and add it into the visualisation.

    <p>
    We are also promoting the project through social media platforms such as Twitter (link),
    Facebook (link), so please provide us with Flickr (link), Pintrest (link) and Tumblr groups and pages that are also being used as
    ‘unintentional’ archives (they should be listed under Online – Community).
